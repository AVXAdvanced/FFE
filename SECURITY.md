## Supported Versions

Below is the a list of all FFE Versions to be released, and what kind of support they will recieve. 
Usually older versions get unsupported after a big change is made. If only small bug fixes happen, older versions may still recieve full support.

### Support Available

This means that full support is guaranteed. We will try to answer any questions you may have.

### Partial Support Available

This means that some questions you may have, such as how to navigate the UI, or how some functions work, will still be answered.
However, help with lost files or damage to your system will be ignored.

### Unsupported

This means that no questions will be answered. 
If you need help with an unsupported version, ask other users or check old documentation.
WE STRONGLY RECOMMEND UPDATING FROM ANY UNSUPPORTED VERSION!
