# Reporting Security Vulnerabilities in FFE

## Introduction

If you've found a security vulnerability in a recent release of FFE and would like to report it, Thank you! Your help makes sure FFE stays safe and secure for everyone. 

In this file, we'll outline how you can easily and privately share potential security vulnerabilities you have found with the developer(s) of Friend File Encryptor (FFE).
Please read through the entire file before reporting any issues to make sure there aren't any issues in your report.

## Filing a report

Actually reporting the issue is quite simple, as we strongly encourage you to do it.

To contact the developer(s) of FFE, you can write an email to:

neotek.avx@gmail.com

Please outline the issue and any code related to it, in an easy to read format. 
Note: your report must be in English.

## What we'll do

Once we've received your report, we'll make sure to address it as quickly as possible, and you will receive a response about 2-4 business days after filing your report.
If your issue is minor, it will most likely be implemented in the next planned release of FFE.
If your issue is urgent, a hotfix may be released quickly.

### Thanks for helping keep FFE safe!
