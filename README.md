# FFE (Friend File Encryptor)

FFE is a new (and easier) way to share files with your friends (or really anyone who you want) without other people taking a peek.

Basically, you share your key file with all your friends, and then you can effortlessly share files between eachother without having to enter a password every time.

FFE supports a single main key.

FFE is written in Python, and is fairly lightweight and meant to be accessible for everyone.

The program currently supports Windows (x64/x86) only.

FFE requires the following:

 Windows 7 (x64/x86) or higher
 Microsoft Visual C++ 2015 Redistributable (x64/x86) - 14.0.23026 or higher.
 300 MB Availible HDD/SSD space or more (Calculated for FFE and C++ Redistributable)

FFE features a basic malware detection feature (due to the vulnerabilities in Python) that informs you upon startup if suspicious programs are found running.
Please report any known malware here in the GitHub (under issues preferrably) so I can make FFE safer for everyone.

FFE is currently in Open Beta so please expect and report bugs/errors here in the GitHub so I can fix them.
Remember, fixing bugs may take a while, but I will try my best! :)

Thanks for considering FFE!
