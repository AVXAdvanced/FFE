## Introduction

FFE is a good looking, advanced File Encryption Program! With FFE you have the versatility to encrypt your files using a Key File as your password, or well.. a literal password. With a Key File, you can easily distribute that file between friends so everyone who has said Key File can easily decrypt and encrypt files within your friend group! With a Password, you gain amazing security, and only people who know the Password can open your files. This is great for sending a file to only one person, or to lock your files on your own computer so no one else can see them.

The good part? FFE supports any files. You heard that right. You have the power to encrypt anything you want! Completely for free by the way!

FFE is based on Python and uses AES-GCM for the best possible security and file tampering protection.

If you're not convinced, go see for yourself! Installing FFE is easy as 1-2-3.. or.. how many steps are in the installer I guess. I promise it's not that many :)

## Requirements

You'll need a computer with the following items to properly run FFE:

- Microsoft Windows 10 (x86/x64)
- Microsoft Visual C++ 2015 Redistributable (x86/x64) - 14.0.23026
- 2 GB RAM (x86), 4 GB RAM (x64)
- 512 MB of free disk space

## Debugging

With recent FFE releases, debugging has become a breeze! To identify any errors you'd like to report, simply:

### 1. Download the most recent FFE.pyw from GitHub

This file is located in this repositories root, or most top-level.

### Change the file type from ".pyw" to ".py". 

The why behind this is that a .pyw file launches without a terminal and a .py file launches with a terminal.

### Done!

FFE will now spawn with a terminal that contains some debugging information!

## Disclaimers & Warnings

Important Notice: FFE is not designed for enterprise-level security and should only be used for personal, non-commercial purposes. You must have explicit permission to use FFE on any files or systems that are not your own. Misuse—such as encrypting files without consent—can lead to serious consequences, and we take no responsibility for such actions.

Please be aware that we cannot assist in recovering encrypted files, even if the encryption was accidental. Use the software responsibly and make backups if necessary.

FFE is provided as-is, with no warranty of any kind. By using FFE, you acknowledge that you do so entirely at your own risk. Any data loss, corruption, or unintended consequences are your responsibility.

Do not use FFE on public, school, or workplace computers, especially those that you do not own or that may contain sensitive information. Unauthorized use on such systems may violate policies or laws.

Lastly, remember that FFE is a personal project developed and maintained by a single individual, not a company or professional organization. While feedback is welcome, support and assistance are not guaranteed.
