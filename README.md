## Introduction

FFE is a simple yet powerful tool designed to make file encryption and sharing effortless—especially within a friend group or small community. With FFE, you don’t have to deal with the hassle of typing in a password every single time you want to encrypt or decrypt a file. Instead, it uses a secure key-based system that keeps things fast, smooth, and way more convenient.

One of the best parts? FFE’s clean, user-friendly interface makes it accessible to everyone—even those who aren’t super tech-savvy. Whether you're on an older PC or a more modern setup, FFE is built to work seamlessly on most computers.

Under the hood, FFE is powered by Python—a lightweight yet capable programming language. This allows it to deliver a responsive and efficient experience without eating up your system's resources. Whether you're sharing files for fun or for work, FFE keeps things secure, simple, and lightning fast.
