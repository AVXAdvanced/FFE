## Introduction

FFE is a simple yet powerful tool designed to make file encryption and sharing effortless—especially within a friend group or small community. With FFE, you don’t have to deal with the hassle of typing in a password every single time you want to encrypt or decrypt a file. Instead, it uses a secure key-based system that keeps things fast, smooth, and way more convenient.

One of the best parts? FFE’s clean, user-friendly interface makes it accessible to everyone—even those who aren’t super tech-savvy. Whether you're on an older PC or a more modern setup, FFE is built to work seamlessly on most computers.

Under the hood, FFE is powered by Python—a lightweight yet capable programming language. This allows it to deliver a responsive and efficient experience without eating up your system's resources. Whether you're sharing files for fun or for work, FFE keeps things secure, simple, and lightning fast.

## Requirements

You'll need a computer with the following items to properly run FFE:

- Microsoft Windows 7 (x86/x64)
- Microsoft Visual C++ 2015 Redistributable (x86/x64) - 14.0.23026
- 1 GB RAM (x86), 2 GB RAM (x64)
- 55 MB of free disk space


## Disclaimers & Warnings

Important Notice: FFE is not designed for enterprise-level security and should only be used for personal, non-commercial purposes. You must have explicit permission to use FFE on any files or systems that are not your own. Misuse—such as encrypting files without consent—can lead to serious consequences, and we take no responsibility for such actions.

Please be aware that we cannot assist in recovering encrypted files, even if the encryption was accidental. Use the software responsibly and make backups if necessary.

FFE is provided as-is, with no warranty of any kind. By using FFE, you acknowledge that you do so entirely at your own risk. Any data loss, corruption, or unintended consequences are your responsibility.

Do not use FFE on public, school, or workplace computers, especially those that you do not own or that may contain sensitive information. Unauthorized use on such systems may violate policies or laws.

Lastly, remember that FFE is a personal project developed and maintained by a single individual, not a company or professional organization. While feedback is welcome, support and assistance are not guaranteed.

## Betas & Development

You can try out beta versions of FFE through the GitHub repository linked below.
Please note that these beta builds are experimental and may contain bugs, incomplete features, or stability issues. They are not guaranteed to function correctly and could potentially harm your files.

We strongly recommend only testing FFE Betas with non-important, throwaway files. Do not use them for anything sensitive or valuable.
